<dl class="faq-list">
  <dt id="what-is-minitel-lite">
    <strong>Q: What's the goal?</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>A:</strong> This is a simulation / challenge designed for you to have fun and learn <b class="red-168 yellow-255-text">while using our development tools</b>.
  </dd>
	<br />
  <dt id="how-do-i-connect">
    <strong>Q: How can I win the challenge?</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>A:</strong> You need to develop a tool that can connect to the server and send the correct authentication code through the provided <a href="{{site.form_endpoint}}" class="green-168 yellow-255-text">form</a>.
    Use your application to establish a TCP connection to <code>{{site.server_host}}</code> and follow the protocol specifications to retrieve the override code.

  <dt id="judges">
    <strong>Q: Who determines code quality and best practices?</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>A:</strong> Our panel of senior NORAD engineers ({{site.judges}}) will perform comprehensive code reviews, assessing architecture quality, test coverage, security practices, and maintainability standards.
  </dd>
	<br />
  <dt id="where-to-post-the-source-code">
    <strong>Q: Where should I post my source code?</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>A:</strong> Your source code should be published in a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Since this is a simulation exercise, please use anonymized personal information and <b class="red-168 yellow-255-text">never commit secret keys or sensitive credentials</b>. Your repository must include clear README instructions for running tests and verifying code quality.
  </dd>

  <dt id="budget">
    <strong>Q:</strong> What is my development budget?
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>A:</strong> You have up to <b>${{site.budget}}</b> in credits available for code generation. Use this budget wisely and focus on purposeful development rather than experimental coding. You will receive an API key for this specific challenge.
