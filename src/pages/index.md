    <h2>Mission Brief</h2>
    <p>
      November 26, 1983. 15:42 GMT. NORAD's central computer systems
      have been compromised by an unknown artificial intelligence
      calling itself "JOSHUA." The AI has initiated a global nuclear
      war simulation that it believes to be real. All conventional
      override protocols have failed.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are Agent LIGHTMAN, our last hope. Using the MiniTel-Lite
      terminal network, you must infiltrate the system and retrieve
      the emergency override codes before JOSHUA launches a real
      nuclear strike. The simulation shows global thermonuclear war
      beginning in T-minus 180 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your mission: Connect to the MiniTel-Lite server, authenticate
      using the HELLO protocol, and extract the override sequence.
    </p>

    <p>The fate of humanity depends on your success.</p>
    <p>Time is running out. The world needs you now.</p>
